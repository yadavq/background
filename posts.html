				<p><strong>WHO ARE YOU ??</strong></p>
				<p>Really , is it very annoying that you don’t have a hobby. Are you criticized by others for not having a hobby. Are you criticized by the ones who have a hobby that you would never have the knowledge of dancing or singing .</p>

				<p><strong>NO HOBBIES INTEREST ME</strong></p>
				<p>As I told you in the last post it is no wrong with having no hobbies , rather i think having no hobby is more interesting that having one. This post explains the same.Let us suppose their is a person who always says “No hobbies Interest me!!” , always has something or the other to do while he is doing nothing. Let me explain.</p>

				<p><strong>HABBIT VS HOBBY</strong></p>
				<p>Let me make this clear, these are 2 sets  whose intersection is never a null set. The people possessing some or the other hobby have a chance to develop a habit in their particular hobby. But, there are some people who do not find the fascinating difference between the 2 H’s. This is what I need you to think about when you ever listen to the worlds like habit or hobby.</p>

				<p><strong>NO HOBBIES SOCIAL ANXIETY</strong></p>
				<p> But, we should ask a question, why 1 million people in India are suffering from this chronic disease. This disease is nothing but the inability to talk to others in a social platform. People feel nervous, embarrassed while being at a social gathering or event. Talking about this would take us a lot more time, so we would do it some other day.

				<p><strong>BEFORE A BREAKTHROUGH THERE IS A BREAKDOWN</strong></p>
				<p>This post is in some or the other way would be a sort of deconstruction of one of the great leaders of the world. These are those people who are responsible for pushing the human race forward. They stand out amongst the others not because they are born great but because they were great with what they did. This might sound a bit off-topic but this is one of the writings, I always wanted to do</p>

				<p><strong>NO HOBBIES(CHOOSE WISELY)</strong></p>
				<p>The murder of family members due to depression which was caused through having no hobbies as said by the culprit and creating a whole new environment for the kids and spreading creativity because the person had no hobbies are very different and opposite in their outcome but quite similar at the core.</p>

				<p><strong>CAN HOBBIES CAUSE DEPRESSION ??</strong></p>
				<p>So, today’s topic is an interesting one. Some people might do not agree with my philosophy of creativity. Still they think that you have to accept the harsh reality that you have no hobbies. In my last post, I told you about the power of good habits. Today is the day for the right mindset. So, allow me to take you the pinnacle of stupidity budding in the internet.</p>
